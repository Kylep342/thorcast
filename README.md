# Thorcast

Thorcast is a weather forecasting service

## Project Info

Currently, it is comprised of 3 components:

- [thorcast-server](https://github.com/kylep342/thorcast-server)
- [thorcast-slack](https://github.com/kylep342/thorcast-slack)
- [thorcast-discord](https://github.com/kylep342/thorcast-discord)

## Motivations

I built this project as a tool to learn several technologies:

- Developing web servers (Flask)
- Caching (Redis)
- Building chat bots (slackclient, discord.js)
- Service orchestration (Docker, docker-compose)

This project also enabled me to enhance some of my current skills:

- Python
- Postgresql
- Node.js
- Git
- pytest

I have had a blast overcoming hurdles along the way, and have enjoyed architecting a (simple) ecosystem.

## Future enhancements

- Fully async webserver (sanic)
- Making the Slack bot available to multiple Slack servers
- A web UI
- Moving to discord.py
